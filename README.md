Hypothesis was if I added more levels of capsules, then the hierarchy would be more complex which could result in a more accurate classification.

Could not run the experiment because additional capsule's mean additional computation. I did not possess hardware capable of running the hypothesis. 

Will explore when I have resources to test it out.
